This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and attempting to access the `takePictureAsync` function before the camera is fully initialized. This can lead to an unexpected error, specifically a 'Camera is not initialized' error.  The issue stems from calling `takePictureAsync` too early in the component's lifecycle, typically before the component's state has reflected that the camera has been successfully started.
